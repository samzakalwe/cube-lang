# The Cube Programming Language
## _A Pimer for Java Developers._

Cube compiles to standard JVM bytecode but differs to Java in five key areas:

- The language is desgined to be a lot more **readable** and **simpler** vthen java
- **Testing** and **logging** are built into the language as core features, not add-ons
- All Java **boilerplate** code (e.g. needing to use Lombok) is removed
- Cube embeds **SQ**L for easier manipulation of in-memory collectionsv and safer ORM
- Cube embeds **JSON** for easier interop with web and REST services
